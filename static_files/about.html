				<p class="text"><i>Isaac Asimov (1920-1992)</i>, is considered one of the three biggest masters of science fiction world. The date of birth of Asimov, 
				whose exact date of birth is unknown, is 2 January 1920 in the official records. He was born into a Jewish family in a village near Smolensk in Russia. 
				Asimov emigrated with his family to the United States when he was three years old. He grew up in New York City. 
				He started writing sci-fi stories before he was 20 years old.</p>
		
				<p class="text">He graduated from Columbia University in 1939 and received his PhD in chemistry from the same university. 
				Then he transferred to Boston University. He became a professor in 1979.</p>
				
				<p class="text">His short science fiction story <i>"Nightfall"</i>, published in 1941, was one of the most famous science fiction stories. 
				In 1968, this story was selected by the <em>American Science Fiction Writers</em> as the best short science fiction story ever written. 
				In 1950, he published his first science-fiction novel called <i>"Pebble In The Sky"</i>.</p>

				<p class="text">Asimov has gained a worldwide reputation with his <i>"Foundation"</i> and <i>"Robot"</i> series, which he started writing in the 1950s and continued for many years. 
				He was honored with Hugo and Nebula awards countless times. He wrote <strong>more than five hundred works</strong> during his lifetime including the fiction and non-fiction. 
				Asimov, who was working without knowing what the rest and breathe, has devoted himselft to the purpose of his life which he stated in a television interview.
				And he worked uninterruptedly for this purpose. That purpose was to leave the effects to spread even after death. Asimov has reached his goal. 
				Lots of novels are influenced from him and lots of movies are adapted. With his immortal works, Asimov continues to give the light of a great science fiction genius to the future of humanity.</p>
				
				<p class="text">He had been catched AIDS due to an infected blood which was given to his during a blood transfusion by the bypass in 1983, 
				and he died because of this disease on 6th April of 1992.</p>
				
				<p class="text">Asimov won <strong>more than a dozen annual awards</strong> for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards. 
				He also received 14 honorary doctorate degrees from universities.</p>
